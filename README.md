# Wickra ZK — Go

---

**Zero-knowledge proofs of backtest performance for Go, over the Wickra C ABI hub via cgo.**

[Wickra ZK](https://github.com/wickra-lib/wickra-zk) runs the deterministic `wickra-backtest` engine inside a RISC Zero zkVM guest and turns the receipt into a proof of the report's hash and headline metrics that reveals neither the candles nor the strategy. This package is the Go binding: it consumes the C ABI hub through cgo and exposes the `Prover` handle with the same JSON command envelope as every other binding.

## Install

Use the published **`wickra-zk-go`** module, which bundles the prebuilt C ABI
library for every platform, so `go get` + `go build` works with no extra steps (a
C compiler is still required, as the binding uses cgo):

```bash
go get github.com/wickra-lib/wickra-zk-go
```

## Quick start

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	wickra "github.com/wickra-lib/wickra-zk-go"
)

func main() {
	p := wickra.New()
	defer p.Close()

	cmd := `{"cmd":"prove","spec":{"strategy":{...}},` +
		`"candles":[{"time":1,"open":100,"high":101,"low":99,"close":100,"volume":1000}]}`

	proof, err := p.Command(cmd)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	fmt.Println(proof) // {"receipt":…,"journal":{"report_hash":"…","dataset_commitment":"…","guest_id":"…",…},"version":"…"}
	fmt.Println(wickra.Version())
}
```

## Commands

| Command | Payload | Response |
|---------|---------|----------|
| `prove` | `{spec: {strategy, dataset_commitment?}, candles}` | `{receipt, journal, version}` |
| `commit` | `{candles}` | `{dataset_commitment}` |
| `verify` | `{proof}` | `{report_hash, dataset_commitment, guest_id, sharpe, pnl, n_trades}` |
| `version` | — | `{version, guest_id}` |

The envelope is documented once, in
[docs/ZK.md](https://github.com/wickra-lib/wickra-zk/blob/main/docs/ZK.md#the-command-envelope).
`dataset_commitment` may be omitted from a `prove` spec; the host computes it
from the candles. Proving runs a zkVM: seconds to minutes.

Domain errors are reported in-band as `{"ok":false,"error":"…"}`; the Go
`error` is reserved for ABI-level failures (a null argument, a caught panic).

`wickra-zk-go` is generated from this directory by the release pipeline: it
mirrors the Go sources, the vendored C ABI header (`include/wickra_zk.h`) and
the prebuilt libraries under `lib/<goos>_<goarch>/` for Linux and macOS (risc0
has no Windows host, so there is no Windows library to mirror).

## Building from this repository (contributors)

This `bindings/go` directory is the development source. To build it directly,
compile the C ABI hub and stage the library into the per-platform directory cgo
links against:

```bash
cargo build -p wickra-zk-c --release
mkdir -p bindings/go/lib/linux_amd64                 # match your GOOS_GOARCH
cp target/release/libwickra_zk.so    bindings/go/lib/linux_amd64/   # Linux
cp target/release/libwickra_zk.dylib bindings/go/lib/darwin_arm64/  # macOS (arm64)
cp target/release/wickra_zk.dll      bindings/go/lib/windows_amd64/ # Windows
```

Then, with the library on the loader path, run `go test ./...` from this directory.
